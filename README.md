# Seven-Segment-Display-Driver
This project is a driver for a 7-segment display, implemented in Verilog. The code describes how to display decimal values (0-9) on two 7-segment displays (HEX1 and HEX0) based on inputs from 8 switches (SW). Use only simple Verilog assign statements and specify each logic function as a Boolean expression.
The switches are divided into two groups:
1.  SW[7:4]: Controls the value displayed on HEX1.
2.  SW[3:0]: Controls the value displayed on HEX0.
